First thanks for stop by.

I'm trying to build a renderer framework based on Qt OpenGL. 

At present, what I've completed is as follow:

Skeleton animation

Instanced rendering

Model loading

Deferred rendering

Shadow mapping

Third person camera

Fog

I'm not satify with current framework, it's likely to refactor in the future.
